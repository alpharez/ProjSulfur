#  Project Sulfur

Roguelike where you are on board a seed or generation ship travelling interstellar space.  The player isn't supposed to realize this.  People have woken up and the tech hasn't been understood for a thousand years.  There's all these tech objects around that people don't understand.

The radiation environment of deep space is very different from that on the Earth's surface, or in low earth orbit, due to the much larger influx of high-energy galactic cosmic rays (GCRs). Like other ionizing radiation, high-energy cosmic rays can damage DNA and increase the risk of cancer, cataracts, and neurological disorders.[11] One known practical solution to this problem is surrounding the crewed parts of the ship with a thick enough shielding such as a thick layer of maintained ice as proposed in The Songs of Distant Earth, a science fiction novel by Arthur C. Clarke (note: in this book the ship's mammoth ice shield is only in the forward part of the ship, preventing micrometeors from damaging the ship during its interstellar journey).

Players gain skills so that they can harness this tech to gain levels and power.

People have split up into tribes.

*They have forgotten their purpose.  The generation ship has been orbiiting the destination planet for hundreds of years.  All these people have to do is activate drop ships to get to the planetary surface.*

*The Enzmann starship is a concept for a manned interstellar spacecraft proposed in 1964 by Dr. Robert Enzmann. A three million ton ball of frozen deuterium would fuel nuclear fusion rocket engines contained in a cylindrical section behind that ball with the crew quarters. The craft would be about 2,000 feet (600 m) long overall.*
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzmann_starship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzmann_starship)

The spacecraft would be modular, and the main living area would be three identical 300 feet (91 m) wide and long cylindrical modules. The Enzmann could function as an interstellar ark, supporting a crew of 200 but with space for expansion.

## phase 1 game

1) To get to release candidate this has to be a playable game, start to finish.  player starts off top level of ship and has to go through zones to get to the bottom level where there are drop ships.  Winning condition is activate drop ship to planet.
2) Player fights critters, finds items, learns the language by reading lots of terminals... levels up, gains attributes....
3) figures out how to get to the lower zones where stuff is harder
4) levelling up rolls better stats so strength and dex go up for fighting... int and wisdom go up for learning text... charisma goes up for interactions
5) eventually player gets to bottom level... he has to get key card to activate drop ship hangar and then activate ship.
6) end screen with view of planet... roll credits.
7) would be nice to have each zone be scrolling.... and stairs can go up and down
8) Zone 1 - sulfur pods, Zone 2 - Propulsion, Zone 3 - Horticulture, Zone 4 - Crew Habitat?, Zone 5 - Drop ships
9) Persistence

## Chemically induced suspended animation:
Basically you let the subject breath a atmosphere which contains slight doses of Hydrogen Sulfur (H2S), a gas that it is toxic and in higher doses is lethal. The H2S molecule binds to the same place as oxygen normally would thus reducing the organism capability to take in oxygen. The body then has an undersupply of oxygen and slows down the metabolism to counteract this danger.

## gameplay

Explore and learn from environment.  Not necessarily a ton of fighting.  Solving puzzles... getting hurt by the environment?  Breaking security?

During the first part of the game, fighting with be against rats or whatever critters are annoying.  People will be friendly.  Only once we venture out of our starting zone, will we encounter enemies.

Gain XP by finding things, tinkering with things... maybe you break some terminals but you get better... level up and gain intelligence so next time maybe you can figure out the tech.

## Skill trees:
- need ancient language skills to be able to read anything.... the higher your level the less scrambled things are. each level up is 10% more readability.  For example:  you come across a terminal and you can see some garbled letters.  It says to hit a key to do 1 thing or another key to do something else... you can't read it too good, but you think you know to hit the first key... something scrambled but you think you can make it out... well that command does something bad... maybe kills you.  Everytime you try to read something, there's a chance that your skill goes up a tick.
- tech skills... need skills to work on ancient tech.  You may break a lot of tech to skill up.

- player attributes affect how these skills work.  Intelligence needs to be high enough to figure stuff out.

## Enemies:
- critters... maybe pets were brought and those evolved over time.. like feral dogs... feral hamsters?  whistle pigs?
- people from other clans... the player would pick a clan (tech/engineering, police/military, officers, cooks/horticultural,... )... these groups might not be friendly with each other.
- hortag - horticultural/aggriculture... they know how to grow food.
- milpol - fighters, not too bright
- eggheads - scientists
- engs - engineers

## Items

- terminals -- 
- weapons?  crowbar?  fire ax?  wrench? stun wand?

## other data

Deuterium (or hydrogen-2, symbol D or 2H also known as heavy hydrogen) is one of two stable isotopes of hydrogen (the other being protium, or hydrogen-1). The nucleus of deuterium, called a deuteron, contains one proton and one neutron, whereas the far more common protium has no neutron in the nucleus. Deuterium has a natural abundance in Earth's oceans of about one atom in 6420 of hydrogen. 
Thus deuterium accounts for approximately 0.02% (or, on a mass basis, 0.03%) of all the naturally occurring hydrogen in the oceans, while protium accounts for more than 99.98%. The abundance of deuterium changes slightly from one kind of natural water to another (see Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water).

A lot of the terminals in the game would not show anything relevant to the game.
